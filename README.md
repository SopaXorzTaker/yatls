# yatls - yet another TLS implementation
YaTLS is a minimal implementation of the Transport Layer Security protocol, version 1.2 (RFC5246).
It is not considered secure, since it doesn't comply to the standard completely, so it should only be used for
  educational purposes.
 
YaTLS depends on ricmoo's AES library, pyaes, which is the only external dependency.
All of the code included is public domain, see LICENSE.
